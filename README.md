# Monkies!!

Create a `Monkey` class in a new js file, `main.js` , which has the following attributes:
* `name` - a string, which should be set by a method called `assignName`
* `species` - a string, which should be determined by some input
* `foodsEaten` - an array, which should be initialized as an empty array


And the following methods:
* `eat(food)` - adds a food (a string) to the list of foods eaten
* `introduce` - introduces self, with name, species, and what it's eaten
* `countFoods` - that states how many items of food have been eaten
* add a new property to the constructor called `bananasEaten` that has a default value of 0.  Modify your `foodsEaten` method so that every time a monkey eats a banana it adds to the `bananasEaten` property.
